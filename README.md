# Harnessing Software to Command Hardware: Finch Robot Project

This Finch robot project involves creating a program that takes a user-provided hexadecimal number, converts it through various numerical systems, and uses the results to control the robot's movements and LED colour.

Please note, this project represents a basic version intended to ensure all required functionality works correctly. As this work stems from formal university submissions, it is not publicly released. This version is shared for educational purposes and to highlight the key aspects of the project.
